# My Third Blog Post

Published on: 2025-05-17

Now that I can create an Astro project and see it on web, and everything feels intuitive and makes so much sense. If I have to compare this tutorial with others I've tired (for other framework!), they tend to go above the head after first few units.. like, seriously! OR its just me with potato brain ~ "( - âŒ“ - )

Anyways, but I still not sure what else can be build with Astro as it says "for content heavy/driven websites".. but I don't have such use case in my head. So not sure wat else gonna build beside a blog / journal website...
