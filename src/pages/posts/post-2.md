# My Second Blog Post

I was little afraid that I will not be able to continue or ever finish it, but after successfully completing unit 0 and unit 1, I feel confident. I will be doing my besto!

Also, this was the first time (not really, tried before with other stuffy, so second time!) working with nodejs ando stuff. So, I feel more confident in working with nodejs side as well. ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ
